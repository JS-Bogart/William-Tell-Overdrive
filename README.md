### Gameplay
The gameplay revolves around steering a plasma bolt through space. The player must dodge incoming asteroids, planets, and stars. There is a kinetic energy bar on the right that goes down every time an asteroid is hit.

If the player makes it to the end of the game (which coincides with the end of the William Tell Overture), they must hit planet-like space station that is threatening Earth in order to win.
